            <p align="justify">Mars Exploration is tough, with every mars mission several technical difficulties come along. We highlight several challenges that comes on the way of Mars exploration.</p>

              <center><b><h3>Distance</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">One of the primary concerns about operating a spacecraft around Mars compared with the Earth is that it’s so far away! <br />
                Mars is so far away in fact that it takes radio signals quite a long time to get from the spacecraft back to Earth. During Curiosity EDL (Entry, descent and landing), the delay was approximately  13 minutes, 48 seconds, about mid-way between the minimum delay of around 4 minutes and the maximum of around 24 minutes. Figure 1 below shows the Mars Express delay display on the control system, showing us the critical numbers of one-way light time, two-way light time and the distance from Earth. This makes it a challenge to operate Mars Express because it’s hard to have a conversation with the spacecraft, or react if anything happens on board. If there is a problem and the spacecraft tells us, we won’t know for around 13 minutes, and then even if we react straight away it’ll be another 13 minutes before our instructions get back to Mars – there’s a lot that can happen in half an hour at Mars (for example a whole Curiosity landing)!

              <center><b><h3>Communication</h3></b></center> <p align="justify"> The communication between the Earth and Mars can be greatly affected or blocked by the sun. When the sun obscures the Earth’s view of the planet, communication with the planet is not possible for about several weeks. Communications delay is the logistical nightmare of traveling millions of kilometres away from Earth and the impossibility of receiving a re-supply in any reasonable amount of time. Whereas astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) can receive a fresh shipment of supplies within a few hours of its being lifted from the launchpad, humans on Mars would need to wait at least 6 months for any such shipment to arrive.
                <br />This means that any medicine or replacement equipment required by the crew must be brought along or sent ahead of time—and in the case of any unforeseen illnesses or medical conditions, a rapid evacuation from Mars isn't possible like it is from the ISS.
                <br />With communications-delays and lengthy travel times, astronauts venturing to Mars will need to be capable of resolving a wide range of potential problems autonomously and with limited resources. Any failure to do so could be a death-sentence.

            <center><b><h3>Mars orbit with less fuel</h3></b></center> <p align="justify"> For a successful Mars mission the initiation should be proper i.e. for safety and operational reasons, the spacecraft that will travel to Mars will likely not land on the surface immediately upon reaching the Red Planet. The entire spacecraft must first enter Mars orbit and then deploy a lander down to the surface. The ability to first orbit the planet before landing on it will also give the astronauts an opportunity to observe the atmosphere to ensure that there are no dust storms or hazardous weather at the location where they plan on landing.
<br />To enter Mars orbit, scientists are planning on using a method called aerocapture. Aerocapture is an orbital transfer maneuver used to reduce the velocity of a spacecraft from a hyperbolic trajectory to an elliptical orbit around the targeted celestial body.
<br />One of the major problems that could arise is of getting a spacecraft to another planet -to get it out of Earth's orbit. So the spacecraft should be travelled with a high enough velocity to break [free of] the Earth's gravity field. Then, when the spacecraft gets to its destination planet, it has to slow down enough so that it is 'captured' into orbit around that planet's gravity field. A process called aerobraking has been used successfully in previous missions.
<br />Aerobraking uses propulsion to first insert the spacecraft into orbit (orbit capture) and then circularizes (or achieves the desired orbit, otherwise known as orbit trim) by having the spacecraft pass through the upper part of the atmosphere several times. Aerocapture, on the other hand, performs both the orbit capture and orbit trim in a single pass through the deeper atmosphere. Typically, the slowing down of a spacecraft is done by firing retro-rockets, or rockets that fire in the opposite direction than the spacecraft is traveling.
<br />Hence, this method will require a lot of fuel that has to be carried all the way until the spacecraft reaches Mars. It adds additional weight to an already heavier vehicle and is very expensive.

          <center><b><h3>Managing the weight</h3></b></center>: <p align="justify"> Developing systems for a manned mission to Mars will require a careful balancing act between minimizing the weight and figuring out how to use the least amount of fuel possible. It is a comparatively easier task to send rover and robots to the Martian atmosphere as they are lightweight, but when it comes to manned mission many difficulties arises as the weight of the spacecraft increases to deal with the thin Martian atmosphere. Due to this if weight is alarmingly high , the spacecraft will enter the atmosphere with excessively high velocities as the kinetic energy will be 100%, hence it will land on the surface with a great amount of force which might damage the various components associated with the spacecraft and mission failure may be caused.
          <br />One of the greatest design barriers engineers are facing is dealing with the amount of fuel that will be needed to send a spacecraft on such a round trip distance. More fuel means more weight, and more weight means the need for more fuel to transport that weight.

        <center><b><h3>Expensive Collaborations</h3></b></center>: <p align="justify"> A high expenditure moves parallel to massive development of science and technology. The exploration to Martian surface is no different.
            <br />Let us take the example and budget breakdown of <a href="http://www.mars-one.com/" id="weeklylinks">Mars One</a>
            <br />Mars One estimates the cost of bringing the first four people to Mars at US$ 6 billion. This is the cost of all the hardware combined, plus the operational expenditures, plus margins. For every next manned mission including hardware and operations, Mars One estimates the costs at US$ 4 billion. The missions progresses through development phases A to D. According to the company, the updated numbers could show higher development or construction cost than the current estimates. <br />The cost could also increase if more components than accounted for fail and need to be replaced. There are also opportunities to lower the mission cost, for example if larger, more economical launchers become available. Mars One's business case projection supports at least double the budget.
            <br />Current Cost Breakdown Estimates of the company:
            <br /><br />🖸 US$ 450 million for the first unmanned Mars lander mission
            <br />🖸 US$ 425 million for the communications satellite
            <br />🖸 US$ 900 million for the first rover mission
            <br />🖸 US$ 2,300 million for all remaining outpost hardware and supplies before the human mission
            <br />🖸 US$ 1,250 million for sending the first crew to Mars
            <br />🖸 US$ 582 million for operations, including astronaut selection and training
            <br />🖸 US$ 93 million for ground stations and other costs
            <br />🖸 US$ 1,850 million per year for follow-up human missions

        <center><b><a id="github" style="font-size:30px">CHALLENGES DURING LANDING</a></b></center>

        <p align="justify"> As Mars explorers have learned the hard way, it's not typically the fall that kills you, it's the landing. Landing technology has matured significantly in the 40 years since NASA began exploring extra-terrestrial surfaces. Each generation of landing technology has attempted to resolve the challenges posed by the previous generation. The Skycrane Landing System represents the latest stage in that evolution that we have already seen during the landing of NASA's Curiosity rover.
          <br />While going  through the research described in the paper “The Challenges of landing on Mars” by Tommaso P. Rivellini that was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration we found out various technologies of landing systems used over the years and also the technical limitations attached to each.

          <br />·      In the early 1960’s  the basic landing leg system was developed for the lunar surveyor and the Apollo programs. It was the first generation of landing systems on extra-terrestrial surfaces. There were several challenges of this type of landing system. Firstly, the challenge was to enable the lander to touchdown safely in regions with rocks.  For this the legs had to either be long enough to raise the belly of the lander above the rocks, or belly of the lander must be made strong enough to withstand contact with the rocks. In such a situation the lander becomes top heavy and there is  high amount of instability while landing. Secondly, one of the major challenges of legged landing system is ensuring safe engine cutoff. Thirdly, rover egress phase is a major concern while landing as they are mostly bidirectional.

      <p align="justify"> Air-bag landing systems were used as the second-generation landing system that was developed for the Mars Pathfinder mission and subsequently improved upon for the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions. As compared to the first generation systems of landing the air-bag landing systems completely eliminated the challenges of instability and improper orientation of the lander before landing. Although the air-bag landing system has addressed some of the challenges and limitations of legged landers, it has also introduced some challenges of its own. Horizontal velocity control using solid rockets and air-bag testing were significant challenges for both the Mars Pathfinder and MER missions.

      <p align="justify"> In 2012, Curiosity rover created a huge buzz across the globe which was designed to explore the crater gate on Mars as part of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission (MSL). The curiosity rover was accommodated by a third generation landing system called the Sky crane landing system(SLS). SLS eliminates the dedicated touchdown system and lands the fully deployed rover directly on the surface of Mars, wheels first. This is possible because the rover is no longer placed on top of the lander. In the SLS, the propulsion module is above the rover, so the rover can be lowered on a bridle, similar to the way a cargo helicopter delivers under slung payloads. The central feature of the SLS architecture is that the propulsion hardware and terrain sensors are placed high above the rover during touchdown. As a result, their operation is uninterrupted during the entire landing sequence. One important result of this feature is that the velocity control of the whole system is improved, and, therefore, the rover touches down at lower velocity. There is no last-meter free fall associated with engine cut-off, and, because dust kick-up is minimal, the radar antennas can continue to operate even while the rover is being set down on the surface. The lower impact velocity has two effects. First, the touchdown velocities can now be reliably brought down to the levels the rover has already been designed for so it can traverse the Martian surface. Second, the low velocity, coupled with the presence of bridles until the rover’s full weight has been transferred to the surface, results in much more stability during landing.
