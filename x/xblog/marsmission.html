                <br /><p align="justify"><b>#1</b>: It was called Marsnik 1 in the West. The spacecraft took off on 10 October 1960. It was the payload of the Molniya 8K78 rocket - a four-stage rocket. The third stage of the rocket failed and was shut down at T+309s. The reason for the failure was severe resonant vibrations causing a malfunction in the gyroscope and thus damaging the altitude control system of the rocket.</p>

             <center><b><h3>Mariner (US)</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">
               Mariners 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were designed to investigate Mars.
               <br /><p align="justify"><b>#3</b>: Mariner 3 was launched on 5 November 1964. The launch vehicle used was the Atlas-Agena D. Few of the scientific instruments used were an imaging system, cosmic dust detector, cosmic ray telescope, ionization chamber, and magnetometer. The goal of the spacecraft was to photograph the Martian surface. During the launch, the booster payload fairing failed to separate from the payload. The battery power suddenly dropped to zero and the solar panels couldn’t be unfurled. Even if the shroud was somehow removed, the spacecraft would miss Mars by several million kilometers. Hence, the mission was canceled.</p>

               <p align="justify"><b>#4</b>: Mariner 4 was launched on 28 November 1964. The same scientific instruments were used as in the Mariner 3. It had an octagonal magnesium frame. This housed the electronic equipment, cabling, midcourse propulsion system, and attitude control supplies and regulators. The 28,000+ solar cells used could provide 310W at Mars. The launcher’s first burn put the spacecraft into an Earth parking orbit and the second burn put it in a Mars transfer orbit. The spacecraft had a Mars flow by on July 14 and 15, 1965. The images taken were across 1% of the entire Martian surface. These were stored in the onboard tape recorder and transmitted to Earth 11.5 hours later, which continued till August 3. All in all, the mission was successful.</p>

               <p align="justify"><b>#6</b>: It was launched on 25 February 1969. It was launched with the Atlas-Centaur. It had the same octagonal magnesium frame with four solar panels with 449W of power. It flew by Mars at a distance of 3,429km. On July 31, 26 close-up images were taken. Due to cooling system failure, infrared data in the 6-14nm range could not be collected. For the next few days, image data was transmitted back to Earth following which the spacecraft was set to cruise mode for engineering and communication tests.</p>

               <p align="justify"><b>#7</b>: This along with the Mariner 6 was designed to study the surface and atmosphere of Mars in the search of extraterrestrial life or for development of technology required for long-duration missions. The spacecraft carried a television camera, a UV and IR spectroscope and an IR radiometer. It had some positional calibration issues in between but even then was able to collect 93 far-encounter and 33 near-encounter images of the planet. Unlike previously, it found the center of Hellas to be devoid of craters.</p>

               <p align="justify"><b>#8</b>: It was launched aboard the Atlas-Centaur SLV-3C booster on 9 May 1971. Its objective was to physical and dynamic characteristics of Mars. At T+365s, a malfunction in the pitch rate gyro amplifier caused by a defective diode in the PCB of the pitch amplifier.</p>

               <p align="justify"><b>#9</b>: This was launched aboard the Atlas-Centaur on 30 May 1971. It was the first human-made object to enter orbit around a planet. It was designed to map 70% of the Martian surface from the lowest altitude of 1,500km and the highest resolutions of 1km-100m per pixel with respect to any previous Mars mission. The spacecraft gathered data on atmospheric composition, pressure, temperature and also surface composition including temperature, gravity, and topography. It transmitted a total of 5.4 gigabits of data back to Earth.</p>

               <br /><p align="justify">The total expense of research, development, launch, and support costs of the entire Mariner series was approximately USD 554 million.</p>

             <center><b><h3>Viking (US)</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">
               The Viking program constituted sending two spacecrafts to Mars - the Viking 1 and Viking 2. Each consisted of an orbiter and a lander. The orbiters were to collect images and scientific data from the Mars orbit and the landers from the surface. Both were successful in their missions and are considered to be the main source of most of the knowledge body of Mars through the 1990s and the 2000s.
               <br /><p align="justify"><b>Viking 1</b>: The launch vehicle used was the Titan IIIE-Centaur. The orbiter had an imaging system, atmospheric water detector and infrared thermal mapper. The lander carried an imaging system, spectrometer, seismometer, biological laboratory, weather instrument package and sampler arm. The aeroshell carried a retarding potential analyzer and an upper-atmosphere mass spectrometer. The spacecraft entered orbit on 19 June 1976. The lander later separated from the orbiter and landed on the surface on 20 July 1976. The lander’s remote sampler arm collected samples and although some presence of life could be indicated, test for organic life gave negative results. The orbiter was shut down on 7 August 1980 and contact was lost with the lander on 1 February 1983.</p>
             </p>

           <p align="justify"><b>Viking 2</b>: It was launched on 9 September 1975. The scientific instruments carried aboard the spacecraft were the same as in Viking 1. The lander separated from the orbiter and landed 6,460km away from the Viking 1 lander. The objective of the orbiter was to survey the area and certify landing sites, act as communication relays for the landers and perform their individual scientific investigations. The scientific payload aboard the lander had a total mass of 91kg. Due to radar misidentification, the lander settled on a rock tilted at 8.2°. The same experiments were carried out as previously and the results came out as inconclusive on the question of organic life. The orbiter was turned off on 25 July 1978 while the lander, after battery failure, was turned off on 11 April 1980.</p>
           <p align="justify">The two orbiters returned a total of 51,539 images while the landers 4,500 photos back to Earth.</p>

             <center><b><h3>Phobos (Soviet Union)</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">
               It was an unmanned space program to study Mars and its moons Phobos and Deimos. They were sent aboard the Proton-K rocket.
               <br /><p align="justify"><b>Phobos 1</b>: It had a total mass of 6,200kg making it the heaviest spacecraft launched till then. The spacecraft took off on 7 July 1988. It had onboard equipment for planetary studies, plasma studies and solar studies. Hydrazine was used for attitude control in the beginning and later orbit adjustment after jettisoning of the main propulsion module. Attitude would be maintained using a three-axis control system with pointing maintained with sun and star sensors. The plan of action was to make the spacecraft make a close flyby of Phobos and then deploy the lander with the orbiter in course. But due to a programming error causing a shut down of the orientation and stabilization system, the spacecraft began to lose power. Communication was lost and failure of the mission was announced on 3 November 1988.</p>
               <p align="justify"><b>Phobos 2</b>: It was launched on 12 July 1988. It had an additional payload - a 110kg “hopper” for a total distance coverage of 200m across the Phobos surface. The orbiter was on its intended trajectory but 8 days prior to when the lander was scheduled for release, during a planned communication session, no word was received from the spacecraft. A feeble signal was received indicating the loss of orientation of the spacecraft. The mission was declared lost on 15 April 1989. Altogether of 23 experiments were returned from the spacecraft.</p>

             <center><b><h3>Mars Observer (US)</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">
               The objective of the spacecraft was to determine the elemental characteristics of the surface, its topography and gravitational field, the nature of its magnetic field, the temporal and spatial distribution of volatiles and dust and explore the atmosphere over its period of revolution. The Mars Observer was launched on 25 September 1992 aboard the Titan-III launcher. For primary power, 6 solar panels were used and for auxiliary power, two Ni-Cd batteries were employed. Communication was unexpectedly lost on 21 August 1993 with the probable cause being a fuel line rupture causing loss of attitude control of the spacecraft. The total cost incurred during this mission is estimated to be USD 813 million.

               It was launched aboard the Delta-7925 on 7 November 1996. It was designed as a rapid, comparatively inexpensive recovery of the Mars Observer mission objectives. It consisted of six scientific instruments - the Mars Orbiter Camera to take high-resolution images of the surface features, the Thermal Emission Spectrometer to collect information on the infrared spectrum of energy emitted by the target to study the composition of rocks, soil and the surrounding atmosphere, the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to reproduce a topographic map of Mars, the Radio Science Investigations instrument for measurement of Doppler shift of the radio signals allowing for precise determination of changes in orbit thus allowing for modelling the Mars gravitational field, the Magnetic Fields Investigation instrument consisting of a magnetometer and an electron reflectometer for measuring the magnetic field strength and orientation, and the remnant crustal magnetization; and the Mars Relay used to redirect any received signals from the Mars Observer spacecraft back to Earth. The mission was operational until 2 November 2006 when no response from the spacecraft was received. The mission was officially ended by NASA in January 2007.

             <center><b><h3>Mars 96 (Russia)</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">
               The spacecraft was launched on 16 November 1996 aboard the Proton-K launcher. It had a 3-axis sun/star stabilized craft based on the Phobos design. It had two large solar panels extending out from the sides and a dish antenna perpendicular to one of the panels. The Orbiter carried altogether 12 instruments to study the Martian surface and atmosphere, plasma, fields, and particles including astrophysical study. The plan of action was for it to go into a 3-day transfer orbit about Mars following which the two penetrators would descend on the surface. Unfortunately, the spacecraft was unable to achieve insertion into Mars cruise trajectory and re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere on 17 November 1996 and crashed in a presumed 25,600 sq km area. The reason for the crash is yet unknown and the failure investigation board concluded that a lack of telemetry data prevented the identification of the cause of the failure.

               The mission’s primary objective was to perform a feasibility analysis of low-cost landings on and exploration of the surface of Mars. The launcher used was the Delta-7925 and was launched on 4 December 1996. The 10.6kg, 6-wheeled rover aboard the main spacecraft was named Sojourner. It comprised of 3 cameras for imaging systems, laser stripers, accelerometers, and potentiometers. During the course of its 83-day mission, it covered hundreds of meters, returned 550 photographs and performed chemical analysis on 16 different locations. Meanwhile, the lander transmitted more than 16,000 images and 8.5 million measurements of atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind speed. The mission was officially terminated on 10 March 1998 due to loss of contact with the Pathfinder.

               The spacecraft’s primary objective was to return a sample from Mars’ moon Phobos back to Earth and study its history. It would also help determine how the material was related to other materials across the solar system. It was launched on the Zenit-2M launcher on 8 November 2011. The dry mass of the lander cruise stage was 730kg while of the scientific payload was 50kg. Attitude control was achieved using sun/star trackers, the Baseless Inertial Unit and a Television System of Navigation and Observation. The mission failed after it was unsuccessful in setting a course for Mars, leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit. It fell back to Earth in an uncontrolled re-entry over the Pacific Ocean. The investigation commission concluded that the mission failed due to “a programming error which led to a simultaneous reboot of two working channels of an onboard computer.”</p>

               The rover was launched onboard the Atlas V 541 rocket on 26 November 2011. The first objective of the mission is to determine if Mars ever had any environmental conditions that supported life. It would look for chemical elements that are the building blocks of life on Earth - Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus and Sulphur. The second objective is to characterize the Martian atmosphere. Studying the weather pattern, distribution of carbon dioxide, water and hydrogen in the atmosphere and measuring the surface radiation are part of the objective. The third is to study the geological processes that created and modified the Martian surface over time. The fourth is to study the radiation levels and other potential hazards in preparation for human exploration of the planet. The instruments used on the rover are the Mast camera, Mars Hand Lens Imager and the Mars Descent Imager. Among the spectrometers used are the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer, the Chemistry and Camera tool, the Chemical and Mineralogy instrument and the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. There are two radiation detectors - the Radiation Assessment Detector and the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons tool. An environment sensor named REMS and an atmospheric sensor named MEDLI are also onboard. The rover weighs a total of 899kg including 80kg of scientific instruments. Unlike the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Curiosity has a radioisotope power system to generate electricity for its operation. Two identical computers onboard called the Rover Compute Element contain radiation hardened memory to tolerate extreme radiation from space. It has an Inertial Measurement Unit for 3-axis positional information for navigation. The rover landed on Mars on 6 August 2012 and received a lot of media coverage.

             <center><b><h3>InSight (US)</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">
               The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft was launched on 5 May 2018 aboard the Atlas V 401 launcher. It is the first robotic explorer to study the interior of Mars - the crust, mantle and core. It has also begun measuring tectonic activity and meteorite impact. Two mini-spacecrafts followed InSight to test miniaturized deep space communication. For attitude control, it has star trackers and an Inertial Measurement Unit backed up by sun sensors. Eight thrusters were used during the cruise for adjusting the spacecraft’s flight path and controlling the roll during those maneuvers. The payload consists of three primary experiments - the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, the Heat Flow and Physical Properties probe, a self-penetrating array of temperature sensors and Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment. The Temperature and Wind Sensor is used to measure the wind speed and temperature at the mission platform surface, a sensor to measure atmospheric pressure and a magnetometer - both to determine external environmental contribution to seismic signals; an IR radiometer to measure the surface temperatures affecting the heat flow experiment and also a passive laser retroreflector. During the landing phase, the spacecraft was controlled in three phases - the entry phase comprised of the small rockets slowing it down initially, then parachutes were deployed while it jettisoned its heat shield and extended its three shock-absorbing legs. After the lander separated from its backshell and parachute, 12 retro-rocket thrusters fired with the help of the onboard guidance system to slow down the rocket. The findings of the lander till date include detection of the first Marsquake, detection of magnetic pulses and magnetic oscillations possibly produced either due to surface magnetic field distortion by the solar wind’s magnetic field or due to the possible existence of liquid water below the surface.</p>
