                <br />A significant advancement in autonomous robot ecosystem is a necessity towards any bigger dream. When it comes to building an ecosystem of robots then building a full scale robot does not always meet all the requirements. First of all it requires a significant amount of money to work on it, further they are less likely to survive in cases where certain parts of it or its dependent platforms fail. In such cases it would be a better decision to design and develop groups of robot / swarm of robots, each group with its own task and expertise. These groups { Network of robots } will communicate with other groups to carry out a complex job needing multiple levels of labour. <br />
                <br />
                We are developing intelligent aerial-swarm robots with booster technology based on rocket engines. Each booster has its own brain and when they network together, the swarm will be able to complete complex tasks. <a href="http://athenas.in/"> Athena</a>s, is an Intellgennt AI and the brain of Project A.R.C.R.E.D, in Greek Mythology, she is the Goddess of Wisdom and Warfare, she takes all the intelligent decisions and senses the environment for the A.R.C.R.E.D Engines. <a href="http://athenas.in/"> Athena</a>s wires the power of Vision, NLP and Psychology,  she rules the world of A.R.C.R.E.D engines and is part of Project A.R.C.R.E.D.

                MIT is working on <a href="https://youtu.be/6aZbJS6LZbs">modular robots</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/MUt1YKtn6kM">magnetic shape-shifters</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wU8Q7gldiMI">Âµtug</a> and various other forms which are small scale robots but can achieve remarkable feat. The same concept can be used  for space exploration. Science fiction movies like Big hero 6 have used large group of microbots which works together to do large tasks. If this technology is to evolve with time in a proper way, then this would be a revolutionary achievement. These robots can have a wide future utilisation on and also off the spacecraft. The beauty of working in groups that even if one member fails the other backs it up. This will help missions in terms of optimization and performance.
                <br /><center><h3> Ambitions </h3></center><p align="justify"><br />
                We are currently designing and developing rovers and custom relandable model rocket engines. There is a lot to achieve when it comes to designing miniature sized rovers. Although significant advances ahve been made in rover technology with NASA producing a series of rovers to explore Mars environment like Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity rovers but much work has not been done in producing miniature size rovers, such that a swarm of them, each with its own special objective can be sent in a single launch. Of course producing miniature size rover with the objective of deploying it is a huge challenge in itself and will come with its own set of problems but on the upside it will also be economically much more efficient provided multiple rovers will be launched at a single go and further the area of exploration will increase by a large degree. Further failure of a single rover would not mean termination of the mission if multiple rovers of the same specifications can be sent. This can be achieved if the dimensions of the rovers are reduced considerably and the concept of swarm robots are put to use. The concept of modularisation in robotics can also serve a great amount into this idea.
                <br /><br />
                Although advancement in space exploration has gone very far with organisation like ISRO which is an asset to the country, but still at the grass root level not much education regarding space is available. ARCRED will be devoted to everyone who seeks knowledge. Along with workshops and awareness programs which will help us fund our various projects, research works, practical designing videos, Model rocket building etc. The contents will constantly be available on the website and the online application platform. Students can login and access anything they require. Star minds in India are present everywhere we want to take those and utilise them for the space research and development of the country.
