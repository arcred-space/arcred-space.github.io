                <br />A significant advancement in the autonomous robot ecosystem is a necessity for any bigger dream. When it comes to building an ecosystem of robots then building a full-scale robot does not always meet all the requirements. First of all, it requires significant capital investment. Further, it is less likely to survive in cases where certain parts of it or its dependent platforms fail. In such cases, it would be a better decision to design and develop groups of robots (a swarm of robots), each group with its own task and expertise. These groups (Network of robots) will communicate with other groups to carry out a complex task needing multiple levels of labor. <br />
                <br />
                We are learning each day and developing intelligent aerial-swarm robots with booster technology based on rocket engines. Each booster has its own brain and when they network together, the swarm will be able to complete complex tasks. <a href="http://athenas.in/"> Athena</a>s is an Intelligent AI and the brain of Project A.R.C.R.E.D. In Greek Mythology, she is the Goddess of Wisdom and Warfare. She takes all intelligent decisions and senses the environment for the A.R.C.R.E.D Engines. <a href="http://athenas.in/"> Athena</a>s wires the power of Vision, NLP, Security and Psychology, she rules the world of A.R.C.R.E.D Engines and is part of Project A.R.C.R.E.D. With advancements in the field of Deep Learning <a href="http://athenas.in/"> Athena</a>s is learning and gaining experience each day.

                Research on modular swarm robotics has picked up very rapidly. MIT is working on <a href="https://youtu.be/6aZbJS6LZbs" id="twitter">modular robots</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/MUt1YKtn6kM" id="twitter">magnetic shape-shifters</a> etc and Stanford on <a href="https://youtu.be/_rWuUUGWAp4" id="twitter">Âµtug</a> and various other small scale robots that can achieve remarkable feats. The same concept can be used for space exploration. Science fiction movies like Big hero 6 have used a large group of microbots that work together to do large tasks. If this technology is to evolve with time in a proper way, it would be revolutionary. These robots can have a wide future utilization on and also off of the spacecraft. The beauty of working in groups is that even if one member fails the other backs it up. This will help missions in terms of optimization and performance.
                <br /><center><h3> Ambitions and Goals </h3></center><p align="justify"><br />
                There is a lot to achieve when it comes to designing miniature-sized rovers. Although significant advances have been made in rover technology with NASA producing a series of rovers to explore Mars environment like Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity, much work has not been done in producing miniature-sized rovers. For example, a swarm of them, each with its own special objective can be sent in a single launch. In all reality, producing miniature-sized rovers with the objective of deploying it is a huge challenge in itself and will come with its own set of problems but on the upside, it will also be economically much more efficient provided multiple rovers will be launched at a single go thereby also increasing the area of exploration. Further, the failure of a single rover would not mean the termination of the mission provided multiple rovers of the same specifications can be sent. This can be achieved if the dimensions of the rovers are reduced considerably and the concept of swarm robots are put to use. The concept of modularization in robotics can also serve greatly to this idea.
                <br /><br />
                Although advancement in space exploration has gone very far with an organization like ISRO which is an asset to the country, yet at the grass-root level not much education regarding space is available. A.R.C.R.E.D will be devoted to aiding anyone seeking knowledge in this regard. We will conduct workshops and awareness programs which will help us fund our various projects, research, practical demonstration videos, model rocket building, etc. The contents will be available 24x7 on the website and with the online application platform, students can log in and access any information they require. Star minds in India are present everywhere. We will help their passion grow, for them to chase their dreams and progress towards space research and development of the country.
                <br /><center><h3> Our Plan </h3></center><p align="justify"><br />
                Our initial target is to build and test model rockets and implement thrust vector control for relanding the booster for reusability. The first model would be to test various solid propellants to make it reach at least 2000ft. The second revision would be to use a payload ejection and recovery system with a multi-stage solid propellant. The third revision would be to use thrust-vector control for re-landing the first stage of the rocket. In parallel, we plan on having a few members look at the aerospike design of the nozzle for usability in model rockets. Upon completion of the third stage, we would attempt using liquid and hybrid propellants as their ignition is controllable and have a higher specific impulse compared to solid propellants. After completion of a few successful tests, we would move on to designing the rover. Our stage-1 rover would be called the COSMO-ZERO  which would have a chassis supporting four-wheeled drive. This would act as a testbed for PCB design followed by software interfacing with a 5-DOF robotic arm and a solar module for auxiliary power supply. Locomotion will be tested in our stage-2 rover: COSMO-E1,  which would have all the features of COSMO-ZERO with the addition of the hexa-pedal system and the rocker-bogie suspension. Post troubleshooting and after a few successful tests, we will move onto our third phase.  During all of this, we will keep a technically-detailed document accompanied by videos accounting for both our accomplishments and our failures on the website <a href="https://arcred.space">arcred.space</a>. At this stage, we will start conducting workshops and competitions in and around the region and also hire as we see fit. The funds collected for these events would directly help fund our future endeavors. We would then create separate groups - one working on the rocket, another working on the rover and the final one looking into developing intelligent and autonomous technology with thrust throttleable capabilities to maneuver around , albeit modular and small-scale, for Mars Exploration.
