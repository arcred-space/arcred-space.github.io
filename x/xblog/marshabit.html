                Mars is the fourth closest planet to the sun and is the second smallest planet after Mercury. It is named after the Roman God of War. Also known as the ‚ÄúRed Planet‚Äù due to its appearance, it is mainly due to the high concentration of Iron Oxide on the surface of the planet. Further due to frequent giant dust storms the entire planet can be covered and this can last for months turning the sky red. Unlike Earth, whose iron concentration sank into its core when the planet was young and molten, NASA‚Äôs scientists thinks that due to the smaller size ( diameter of 6779 km ) and weaker gravitational pull of Mars even though mars have an iron core but abundant iron exists in its upper layer as well giving it its reddish look.The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt.

 <br />Coming back to the question of whether Mars is habitable or not, it depends on the availability of life sustaining resources at Mars. Mars is the only celestial body whose surface condition in terms of temperature and sunlight is similar to Earth but still its surface is not habitable due to the high amount of radiation, low atmospheric pressure and only 0.1% of its atmosphere with oxygen.
Its atmosphere was once thick enough that liquid form water could run on the Martial surface but presently it is too thin to hold water at its surface. Martial surface experiences an atmospheric pressure on an average of about 600 pascal which is about 0.6% of Earth‚Äôs mean sea level pressure. The reason for this is not understood in depth but the theory that tries to justify it is that Mars‚Äô light gravity which is 3.711 m/s¬≤ and coupled with its lack of global magnetic field has made the atmosphere vulnerable to pressure from the solar wind due to the solar storms. The solar storms blast away a ton of solar radiation into the solar system. The  constant stream of particles from the upper atmosphere of the Sun called the Corona has stripped the lighter molecules from Mars' atmosphere and hence thinning it away. Some other theories features the concept of giant impact by a small body which have stripped the atmosphere away.
<br />NASA‚Äôs Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission is specifically launched in order to study the Mars atmosphere. It tracks the rate of loss of atmosphere from Mars. MAVEN carries eight science instruments which are specifically chosen to study Mars atmosphere.

            <p align="justify"> Soon after the arrival of the MAVEN on Mars there was a close approach of the comet Sliding Spring, which passed about 87300 miles from the planet on Oct 19, 2014. Material falling off from the comet went straight into the mars‚Äô atmosphere. Scientists detected magnesium, silicon, calcium and potassium in the Martian atmosphere that came from Siding Spring. the magnetic field of the comet blew away a part of the Red planet‚Äôs atmosphere.
As NASA has stated the MAVEN has been significantly successful and among the various discoveries it made some of them are:
</p>
            <p align="justify">‚≠í Acquired compelling evidence that the loss of atmosphere to space has been a major driver of climate change on Mars.</p>
            <p align="justify">‚≠í Determined that the stripping of ions from the upper atmosphere to space during a solar storm can be enhanced by a factor of 10 or more, possibly making these storms a major driver of loss of the atmosphere through time.</p>
            <p align="justify">‚≠í Discovered two new types of Martian auroras ‚Äì diffuse aurora and proton aurora. Neither type has a direct connection to the local or global magnetic field or magnetic cusps, as auroras do on Earth.</p>
            <p align="justify">‚≠í MAVEN has made direct observations of a metal-ion layer in the Martian ionosphere, the first direct detection on any planet other than the Earth. The ions are produced by a steady influx of incoming interplanetary dust.</p>
            <p align="justify">‚≠í Demonstrated that the majority of the CO2 on the planet has been lost to space and that there isn‚Äôt enough left to terraform the planet by warming it, even if the CO2 could be released and put back into the atmosphere.</p>
            <br />
            <p align="justify">The atmosphere of Earth is about 100 times thicker than that of Mars.according to NASA fact sheet the composition can be broken down as follows:</p>

            <li>Carbon dioxide: 95.32 percent</li>
            <li>Nitrogen: 2.7 percent</li>
            <li>Argon: 1.6 percent</li>
            <li>Oxygen: 0.13 percent</li>
            <li>Carbon monoxide: 0.08 percent</li>
            <li>Also, minor amounts of: water, nitrogen oxide, neon, hydrogen-deuterium-oxygen, krypton and xenon</li>

            <p align="justify">However, water in solid state at the two polar ice caps are enormous. If melted the amount will be sufficient to cover the entire surface to a depth of 11 meters. Large quantities of water ice are thought to be trapped within the thick cryosphere of Mars. Radar data from Mars Express and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show large quantities of water ice at both poles (July 2005). The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008. Geomorphic characteristics of Mars states that liquid form of water also had existed in the past as outflow channels cut across its surface in about 25 places. These outflow channels may be due to the release of large quantity of water from the aquifers causing erosions.</p>

            <p align="justify">With all the condition which includes the high numbers of dust storms, high amount of radiation in the Mars surface and its atmosphere which is confirmed to be getting thinner with time and the remaining factors in order to make it habitable for humans we need to create shelter on or within Mars surface which will mimic Earth‚Äôs atmospheric condition. Creating a colony on Martial surface before human‚Äôs arrival is a vital if long stays are to be expected. For this development in various technical aspects is required:</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>‚úß Autonomous robots</b>: to make Mars surface habitable shelters will be required to build with conditions optimum for human survival. Shells which can not only stop radiations but should also be rigid enough to control the high rate dust storms. NASA‚Äôs is working vigorously on using regolith (soil on Mars surface) along with polymers to create this shell using 3d printing technology. Thus an ecosystem of 3d printing robots needs to be present there before hand which will help us set up the main base setup there. These robot units should be autonomous with various abilities like analysing the regolith quality,excavation abilities and also should be able to analyse Mars surface.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>‚úß 3d priniting technology</b>: at the present state NASA is using the 3d printing technology which is producing the composite material to construct structures on Martial surface. However, at present the speed of printing is slow. But with proper advancement this can be a revolutionary solution.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>‚úß Other primary requirements</b>:  requirements like power which can be obtained from nuclear reactors and solar source. Oxygen and water requirements need to be met. Further continuous habitability of the habitat is required to ensure the accessibility of the entire habitat in case of any failures.</p>

            <p align="justify">Creating the shelter should take into account the harsh environment challenges as well as it should also put an eye onto the psychological effect of the conditions on the people leaving there. AI spacefactory‚Äôs MARSHA takes care of this particular event. AI SpaceFactory was awarded as the winner of the NASA‚Äôs Centennial Challenge for the design of <a href="https://youtu.be/XnrVV0w2jrE" target="_blank">MARSHA</a>.</p>
            <center><img src="./img/habitat4.png"><h6>Figure 3: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</h6></center>
            <p align="justify">NASA‚Äôs SwampWorks laboratories is working on new exciting endeavours of technologies like using regolith to make propellants. Researchers are also looking to utilize regolith for constructions in Martial surface by extracting of the metals using molten regolith electrolysis.
