                <b>SpaceX</b> is the only private organisation that has achieved the capability of returning a spacecraft from Low Earth Orbit, which it accomplished in 2010. It was founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk in 2002, who back then had no rocketry or space travel background. With the goal primarily to reduce the space travel cost, they have  one more ambitious goal that is to colonise Mars. SpaceX have gained worldwide attention for a series of milestones. Along with being successful the company is exceptionally economical aiding to this is the fact that SpaceX has almost perfected the art of reusability of their rockets. spaceX has a series of rockets on which successful vertical landing is achieved. 22 December 2015 observed the first ever successful return and vertical landing of the first stage of an orbital rocket in the form of Falcon 9 flight 20. Big Falcon Rocket shortened for BFR is a fully reusable launch vehicle and spacecraft system. This system is intended to be used for functions like Mars colonisation,Earth-lunar transport etc. the BFR system is intended to completely replace the existing systems of SpaceX  adding substantial capabilities to support long-duration spaceflight in the cislunar and Mars transport flight environment.

                <center><b><h3>FALCON 1</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">Spacex launches FALCON 1 and becomes the first private organisation to develop liquid fuel rocket and reach Earth orbit on September 2008. It was a two-stage-to-orbit rocket, the first stage was powered by a single Merlin engine which was again developed by SpaceX themself. Merlin engines use RP-1 and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse. The second stage was powered by a single Kestrel engine which was again developed by Spacex. On july 14,2009 Falcon 1 made its final flight and successfully delivered Malaysian RazakSAT satellite to orbit which was SpaceX’s first commercial launch.

            <center><b><h3>FALCON 9</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">SpaceX launches FALCON 9 for the first time on June 2010 and met 100% of mission objectives on the first flight. FALCON 9 is a two-stage-to-orbit medium lift launch vehicle. It is powered by Merlin engines. Unlike other rockets the FALCON 9 was a new idea as it is partially reusable, the first stage of the rocket is capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing back vertically on the ground after separating from the second stage.On December 2013 Falcon 9 reaches Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. On April 2014 FALCON 9 first stage landed successfully on Atlantic Ocean. On June 2014 FALCON 9 reusable test vehicle flies 1000 M.Vehicle completes highest leap to date, lands safely.on December 2015 FALCON 9 delivered 11 communications satellites to orbit and its first stage successfully lands on Landing Zone 1 and becomes the first ever orbit class rocket to land. On April 8, 2016, the Falcon 9 rocket launched the Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, and the first stage returned and landed on the "Of Course I Still Love You" droneship.

            <center><b><h3>DRAGON</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">DRAGON becomes the first privately developed spacecraft in history to re-enter from low-Earth orbit on december 2010 .Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. On May 2012 Dragon became the first private spacecraft to visit space station. On JUNE 2017 first DRAGON re flight took place. This Dragon resupply mission represented the first reflight of a commercial spacecraft to and from the International Space Station.Currently under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program SpaceX is currently working on the Dragon spacecraft system in order to carry humans to space. Crew Dragon docked with the International Space Station on March 2019, becoming the first American spacecraft to autonomously dock with the orbiting laboratory.

            <center><b><h3>FALCON HEAVY</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons ,a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. Its first stage is composed of three FALCON 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines  generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.

            <center><b><h3>Starship and Super Heavy(formerly known as Big Falcon Rocket (BFR))</h3></b></center> <p align="justify">SpaceX’s vision of making life multiplanetary is well supported with their upcoming launch vehicle starship and super heavy. it is a fully reusable launch vehicle and spacecraft system. It is a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle with a capacity of at least 150000kg to the Earth orbit.  SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Rocket represent a fully reusable transportation system designed to service all Earth orbit needs as well as the Moon and Mars. This two-stage vehicle—composed of the Super Heavy rocket (booster) and Starship (ship)—will eventually replace Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon. By creating a single system that can service a variety of markets, SpaceX can redirect resources from Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon to Starship—which is fundamental in making the system affordable. SpaceX believes that the cost of the starship and super heavy’s operation keeping into mind the reusability aspect of the system will cost them even less than their first launch vehicle FALCON 1 making it cost efficient.
